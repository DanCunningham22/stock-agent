# HOOD - Robinhood Markets, Inc.
**Overall Score: 5.8/10 | Rating: HOLD**
**Date: February 17, 2026**

## Quick Take
Robinhood is experiencing severe technical damage after a 38.5% decline over 3 months, trading well below both key moving averages despite strong fundamental improvements. While analysts maintain bullish targets ($132 vs. $75 current) and the company shows robust earnings growth (+40% YoY Q1), the stock faces significant momentum headwinds in a risk-off macro environment (VIX at 20). This is a "fallen angel" situation—fundamentally sound but technically broken—requiring patience for mean reversion.

## Scorecard
| Category | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Valuation Score** | 7/10 | Trading at 36.7x TTM P/E, 27x forward P/E vs. sector. 43% discount to analyst targets. |
| **Growth Score** | 8/10 | EPS expected +40% current Q, +37% next Q, +18% FY26. Revenue growth accelerating. |
| **Financial Health** | 6/10 | Debt/Equity 129% manageable for fintech. Strong cash flow, TTM earnings $1.88B positive. |
| **Insider Confidence** | 2/10 | **Heavy selling**: CEO sold $45.6M, Former CFO sold $10.6M. No meaningful buying. |
| **Momentum Score** | 2/10 | Death cross forming. -38.5% from 3mo high. Below 50-day ($108.94) and 200-day ($105.94). |
| **Analyst Sentiment** | 8/10 | 19/24 Buy/Strong Buy. Mean target $132 (+76% upside). Improving recommendations. |
| **Macro Alignment** | 4/10 | VIX 20 (elevated fear), financials sector -1.8% 1mo. Yields 4.05% moderate headwind. |
| **Risk Score** | 6/10 | Beta 2.44 = highly volatile. Short interest only 4.3% (low squeeze risk). Down 51% from 52w high. |
| **OVERALL SCORE** | **5.8/10** | **Value trap risk vs. mean reversion opportunity. Fundamentals strong, technicals broken.** |

## Prediction Market Signals
**No Direct Company Markets**: Polymarket shows no specific HOOD markets, but macro signals are relevant:
- **Political uncertainty** markets show elevated 2028 election speculation (no clear signal)
- **Crypto correlation risk**: HOOD's crypto trading volumes are significant revenue drivers. While no specific crypto markets appeared in this pull, the fintech sector is sensitive to crypto sentiment
- **Retail trading activity**: HOOD benefits from retail engagement, which typically increases in high-volatility environments

**Key Takeaway**: Lack of HOOD-specific prediction markets suggests no major binary events priced in (no acquisition rumors, regulatory issues). This is neutral—no tail risk but no catalyst visibility either.

## Macro Context
**Risk-Off Environment Creating Headwinds:**
- **VIX at 20.04**: Above the 15-20 neutral range, indicating elevated fear. This hurts high-beta stocks like HOOD (β=2.44)
- **10-Year Yield 4.05%**: Moderate but stable. Not a major headwind for fintech but competes with "risk-free" returns
- **S&P 500 +0.16%**: Market relatively flat, but financials sector (XLF) down -1.79% in 1 month
- **Sector Rotation**: Energy (+12.9%), Industrials (+7.1%), Defensives outperforming. Capital Markets underperforming

**HOOD-Specific Impact**: As a high-beta fintech play (β=2.44), HOOD gets crushed in risk-off environments. The -38.5% 3-month decline correlates with the VIX spike and defensive sector rotation. The stock needs VIX below 15 and risk-on sentiment to recover.

## Insider Activity
**🚨 MAJOR RED FLAG - Heavy Insider Selling:**
- **CEO Vladimir Tenev**: Sold 375,000 shares worth **$45.6M** on Jan 5, 2026
- **Former CFO Jason Warnick**: Sold 125,000 shares worth **$10.6M** on Feb 9, 2026
- **COO Steven Quirk**: Sold 52,540 shares worth **$4.6M** on Feb 3, 2026
- **Chief Legal Officer Daniel Gallagher**: Sold 10,000 shares ($870K) on Feb 3, 2026
- **CTO Jeffrey Pinner**: Routine small sales (~5,864 shares)

**Analysis**: This is textbook distribution. The CEO selling $45.6M and the former CFO unloading $10.6M (likely departure-related) signals insiders viewed $120+ levels as opportunistic exits. No meaningful insider buying detected. While some may be pre-scheduled 10b5-1 plans, the clustering and size are concerning. **Insiders are selling into strength.**

## Short Interest & Analyst Consensus
**Short Interest: 4.28% of Float**
- **Low short interest** = No near-term squeeze potential
- Bearish sentiment exists but not extreme
- Limited technical catalyst from covering

**Analyst Consensus: Strong Buy/Buy**
- **21 analysts covering**: 4 Strong Buy, 15 Buy, 3 Hold, 2 Sell
- **Mean target**: $132.19 (+76% upside from $75)
- **Target range**: $90-$180
- **Forward P/E**: 27x (implies EPS growth to $2.78)
- **Recent upgrades**: 19 Buy+ ratings vs. 18 last month (improving)

**Interpretation**: Wall Street loves the story but the stock isn't listening. This divergence suggests either (1) analysts are early/wrong, or (2) technical damage needs time to heal. The 76% upside implies significant mean reversion potential IF fundamentals deliver.

## Technical Picture
**Death Cross in Progress - Severe Technical Damage:**
- **Current Price**: $75.26
- **50-day SMA**: $108.94 (price is **-31% below**)
- **200-day SMA**: $105.94 (price is **-29% below**)
- **Death cross**: 50-day approaching crossover below 200-day (bearish)
- **52-week range**: $29.66-$153.86 (currently at 30th percentile)
- **Volume**: 25.7M vs 28.4M avg (below average, no panic selling)

**Price Action:**
- -0.9% (1-day): Flat
- -12.1% (1-week): Breaking down
- -30.8% (1-month): Acceleration
- -38.5% (3-months): **Capitulation territory**

**Support/Resistance:**
- Key support: $60-65 (prior consolidation)
- Resistance: $90 (target low), then $108 (50-day MA)

**Chart Pattern**: This is a failed breakout from the $120-150 range. The stock is in a "falling knife" phase. Technically, wait for stabilization above $85 or capitulation below $60.

## Fundamental Analysis
**Valuation: Reasonably Priced for Growth**
- **P/E (TTM)**: 36.7x vs. 27x forward = 26% compression expected
- **Market Cap**: $67.8B on $4.47B TTM revenue = 15.2x sales (premium)
- **Earnings (TTM)**: $1.88B = massive turnaround from losses
- **Revenue Growth**: Accelerating due to crypto trading, options, and Gold subscription

**Growth Trajectory:**
- **Q1 FY26 estimate**: $0.52 EPS vs. $0.37 prior year = +40% YoY growth
- **Q2 FY26 estimate**: $0.58 EPS vs. $0.42 prior year = +37% YoY growth
- **Full Year FY26**: $2.29 EPS vs. $2.05 prior = +18% growth
- **Full Year FY27**: $2.71 EPS = +18% growth (consistent)

**Business Model Strengths:**
- Crypto trading volumes surging (major revenue driver)
- Robinhood Gold subscription gaining traction (recurring revenue)
- Options trading growing (high-margin)
- International expansion underway

**Balance Sheet:**
- Debt/Equity 129%: Manageable for fintech, not overleveraged
- Cash flow positive: $1.88B TTM earnings
- No dividend: Reinvesting in growth

**Concerns:**
- Revenue concentration risk in crypto (volatile)
- Regulatory overhang (SEC, FINRA scrutiny)
- Competition from Schwab, Fidelity, Coinbase

## Catalysts & Risks
**Upside Catalysts (3-6 months):**
1. **Q1 Earnings Beat**: If HOOD reports >$0.52 EPS, could spark 20%+ rally
2. **Crypto Bull Run**: Bitcoin strength drives trading volumes and revenue
3. **Gold Subscription Milestone**: Hitting 3M+ subscribers would signal recurring revenue scale
4. **Macro Shift**: VIX returning to <15 would benefit high-beta stocks
5. **Technical Reversal**: Stabilization + volume spike could trigger short covering

**Downside Risks:**
1. **Insider Selling Continuation**: If more Form 4s show heavy distribution, confidence craters
2. **Crypto Crash**: 50%+ Bitcoin correction would obliterate revenue
3. **Regulatory Action**: SEC enforcement or payment-for-order-flow ban
4. **Earnings Miss**: Below $0.52 EPS would confirm growth slowdown concerns
5. **Technical Breakdown**: Break below $60 opens door to $40-50 retest

**Binary Events:**
- **Next Earnings**: Late April 2026 (Q1 FY26 results)
- **Crypto Volatility**: Bitcoin correlation remains ~0.7+

## The Trade
**Recommendation: HOLD (if long) / WAIT (if flat)**
**Entry Price (new position)**: $62-68 on capitulation OR $88-92 on breakout above 50-day MA
**Current Price**: $75.26 = Dead zone (no conviction either way)
**Conviction Level**: 3/5 (Medium-Low)

**Rationale:**
The 5.8/10 score reflects a **valuation vs. momentum conflict**. Fundamentally, HOOD is growing earnings 40% YoY and trading at 27x forward P/E with $132 analyst targets—this is objectively cheap. However, the technicals are screaming "catch a falling knife" with:
- Massive insider selling ($60M+ in 6 weeks)
- Death cross forming
- -38.5% drawdown with no stabilization
- High beta (2.44) in a risk-off macro environment

**For Existing Holders:**
- **HOLD if cost basis < $60**: You're in the money, ride it out
- **HOLD if long-term conviction**: Analysts see 76% upside, earnings growth intact
- **CUT if cost basis > $120**: Take the loss, re-enter lower

**For New Buyers:**
- **WAIT for technical confirmation**: Either (1) break above $90 with volume, or (2) capitulation to $60-65 for deep value entry
- **Avoid $70-85 range**: This is no-man's land between support and resistance
- **Scale in**: If entering, use 1/3 positions at $68, $62, $58 to average down

**Options Strategy (Advanced):**
- Sell cash-secured puts at $65 strike, 60 DTE = collect premium while waiting for entry
- Avoid long calls until technical stabilization

**6-Month Price Target:**
- **Bear Case**: $55-60 (crypto crash, earnings miss)
- **Base Case**: $95-105 (mean reversion to moving averages)
- **Bull Case**: $125-135 (analyst targets validated by earnings beats)

**Bottom Line**: This is a **"show me" story**. The fundamentals say buy, but the tape says wait. Insider selling is the tie-breaker pushing this to HOLD. If you believe in the crypto trade and can stomach 2.44 beta volatility, start building at $65-68. Otherwise, wait for technical repair or next earnings catalyst.
